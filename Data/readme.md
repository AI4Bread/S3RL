## Data Preparation

### Download the datasets and place them in the `Data` directory, ensuring the directory structure appears as follows:

```text
Data
├── DLPFCs
│   ├── 151673
│   ├── 151674
│   └── ...
├── Nanostring
├── Human_Breast_Cancer
└── Mouse_Brain_Anterior
```

All datasets can be downloaded from the following links:

- [Nanostring](https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/personal/tang385_purdue_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Ftang385%5Fpurdue%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FSigra%5Fdataset&ga=1)
- [Human Breast Cancer](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/human-breast-cancer-block-a-section-1-1-standard-1-1-0)
- [Mouse Brain Anterior](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jDmx8IjiGhOD__spuuhFB1fWVDJtv5CU)

We also provide the processed datasets for the four datasets used in our experiments, which can be accessed via the link [processed datasets](https://1drv.ms/f/c/e335a8f5a4880556/Ei9UsIT2MVhEuWDQL92VKFMBkUVuETP2800R5YFJFVLmQg?e=naZfgF).

Additionally, we offer the SimCLR code used for extracting semantic features from the images, available at the link [SimCLR](https://github.com/AI4Bread/S3RL/tree/main/Img_encoder). The extracted features are available at the link [semantic features](https://github.com/AI4Bread/S3RL/tree/main/Img_encoder).

Finally, the configurations used in our experiments are available at the link [configuration](https://github.com/AI4Bread/S3RL/tree/main/Best_cfg), enabling the reproduction of the results reported in the paper.
